# OverTheWire Bandit â€” Solutions & Walkthroughs ðŸ§©

This repository contains my personal walkthroughs and notes for the **Bandit** wargame on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

The purpose of this repo is to document how I solved each level â€” including commands, reasoning, and what I learned along the way.  
Itâ€™s intended for **learning and educational purposes only**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The Bandit wargame teaches **Linux command-line basics** and **fundamental cybersecurity skills** through hands-on challenges.

Each level gives you:
- A set of credentials (username/password)
- A remote Linux machine to connect via SSH
- A goal (e.g., find the next password hidden in a file, directory, or command output)
